# HTML & CSS in 30 Days

 I will be doing each week over each day so the course will be over five days


Snippets

I couldn't really download this to github to show my progress but I will write it down.
It was quite confusing at first but I kept it simple.
I will probably just use dash as I have been using it for a while.
I have a few sort cuts already like when I start typing a peace of code the first letters I write
it will come up with code with the same letters.

For example if I want a a 'blockquote' then I type 'block' and it comes up with 'display:block' and 'Blockquote'
I will use that and use Emmet / Zen coding.
